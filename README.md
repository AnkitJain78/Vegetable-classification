# Vegetable Classification using CNN

This project is aimed at classifying vegetables into 15 categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Kaggle and consists of images of various vegetables.

## Features

- Utilizes a CNN model for image classification.
- Trained on a dataset containing images of 15 different types of vegetables.
- Provides a basic React frontend for uploading images.
- Implements a backend server to predict and classify uploaded images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Vegetable Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset]

## Installation

### Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Backend

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Usage

1. Open the web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Upload an image of a vegetable.
3. Wait for the backend server to predict and classify the uploaded image.
4. View the classification result on the frontend.
